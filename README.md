# gitignore
The aim of that repository is too gather gitignores files that can be reused in other projects. Each gitignore file should only be written per language/IDE and stored in a .txt.


# IDE

## LabVIEW

This [gitgnore](./labview.txt) was tested with LabVIEW 2020 and 2021. Currently the Real-Time/Embedded ignored files are missing.
